ID,location,"Considering the potential for a pharmaceutical to be approved in the nm-CRPC space, if approved would you measure PSADT every time you check PSA?",Yes,No,Already measure PSADT every time I check PSA,,Would you employ the use of an app or an online PSADT calculator if it was easily accessible and user friendly?,Yes,No,Already use a formal PSADT calculator,,The phase III clinical trial SPARTAN investigated the effects of Apalutamide on nm-CRPC. The PSADT for patient inclusion in this trial was ?10months. If Apalutamide is approved for nm-CRPC would you consider broadening your inclusion criteria for therapy initiation in nm-CRPC?,Yes,No,,For treatment in nm-CRPC the extension of time between ADT failure and presence of metastases is an important outcome. What extension of time until detectable metastases would you view as successful for a therapy initiated in nm-CRPC?,,,Please rank the following outcomes in order of how significantly they impact your patient management decisions:,Time to symptomatic progression,1,2,3,4,5,Time to subsequent therapy,1,2,3,4,5,Metastasis free survival,1,2,3,4,5,Overall survival,1,2,3,4,5,Quality of life,1,2,3,4,5,,"A minority of urologists prescribe abiraterone or enzalutamide for mCRPC. If an anti-androgen is approved for treatment of nm-CRPC, do you believe urologists will subsequently become more comfortable treating with anti-androgens in mCRPC?",Yes,No,,"During the advisory board, the first presentation of the day connected the mechanism of action of abiraterone to differences in QoL. Did this mechanistic explanation of how abiraterone works provide rationale as to why there are QoL differences observed between Zytiga and Xtandi?",Yes,No,Already understood MOA differences,,How influential would the availability of a well-designed patient support program linked across the prostate cancer continuum be towards your prostate cancer treatment choice?,Not at all influential,Slightly influential,Moderately influential,Very influential,Extremely influential
