ID,location,"Considering the potential for a pharmaceutical to be approved in the nm-CRPC space, if approved would you measure PSADT every time you check PSA?",Yes,No,Already measure PSADT every time I check PSA,,Would you employ the use of an app or an online PSADT calculator if it was easily accessible and user friendly?,Yes,No,Already use a formal PSADT calculator,,The phase III clinical trial SPARTAN investigated the effects of Apalutamide on nm-CRPC. The PSADT for patient inclusion in this trial was ?10months. If Apalutamide is approved for nm-CRPC would you consider broadening your inclusion criteria for therapy initiation in nm-CRPC?,Yes,No,,For treatment in nm-CRPC the extension of time between ADT failure and presence of metastases is an important outcome. What extension of time until detectable metastases would you view as successful for a therapy initiated in nm-CRPC?,,,Please rank the following outcomes in order of how significantly they impact your patient management decisions:,Time to symptomatic progression,1,2,3,4,5,Time to subsequent therapy,1,2,3,4,5,Metastasis free survival,1,2,3,4,5,Overall survival,1,2,3,4,5,Quality of life,1,2,3,4,5,,"A minority of urologists prescribe abiraterone or enzalutamide for mCRPC.
